## Getting started

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  adaptive_chameleon_theme: <latest_version>
```


## Usage

This package allows for an arbitrary number of themes to be defined. Each theme has a unique ID 
of type `int`. To create the themes and map them to IDs, first you have to create an instance of 
`ThemeCollection`, like so:

```dart
final themeCollection = ThemeCollection(
    themes: {
        0: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        1: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.red),
    },
    fallbackTheme: ThemeData.light(), // optional fallback theme, default value is ThemeData.light()
);
```

I would however recommend you introduce a class with `static const int` values to 
associate a name to each ID value for easier reference:

```dart

class AppThemes {
    static const int LightBlue = 0;
    static const int LightRed = 1;
}
final themeCollection = ThemeCollection(
    themes: {
        AppThemes.LightBlue: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        AppThemes.LightRed: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.red),
    },
    fallbackTheme: ThemeData.light(),
);
final darkThemeCollection = ThemeCollection(
    themes: {
        AppThemes.Blue: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        AppThemes.Red: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.red),
    },
    fallbackTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
);
```
**NOTE:** Remember to define a collection of dark themes equivalent in number to the normal themes.

Proceed to wrap your `MaterialApp` with `AdaptiveChameleonThemeWidget` in order to apply and modify UI 
themes.

```dart
import 'package:example/themes.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:adaptive_chameleon_theme/adaptive_chameleon_theme.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AdaptiveChameleonThemeWidget(
            themeCollection: AppThemes.themeCollection,
            darkThemeCollection: AppThemes.darkThemeCollection,
            defaultThemeId: AppThemes.aokiji, // optional, default id is 0
            builder: (context, theme, darkTheme, themeMode) {
              return MaterialApp(
                title: 'Flutter Demo',
                theme: theme,
                darkTheme: darkTheme,
                themeMode: themeMode,
                home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Adaptive Chameleon Theme'),
              );
            }
    );
  }
}
```


## Changing Theme Mode

You can utilise the **changeTheme** function from anywhere in your app. It provides a simple and 
straight forward way of altering the theme modes: **light to dark, dark to light or to system 
default**.

This function has two optional parameters: *dynamic* and *dark*.
If the value of *dynamic* is *true*, it takes precedence over *dark*.

```dart
  // sets theme mode to dark
  AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).changeTheme(dark: true);
  
  // sets theme mode to light
  AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).changeTheme(dark: false);
  
  // sets theme mode to system default
  AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).changeTheme(dynamic: true);
```

## Changing Theme Color

The theme can be set anywhere in the app, provided you have a `BuildContext`, e.g.:

```dart
  AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).setTheme(AppThemes.LightRed);
```

By setting the theme, its ID is automatically saved via the [
`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package, so the next time the 
app starts, the theme can be restored automatically.


### How to get the current theme

#### Current app ThemeMode

```dart
  ThemeMode themeMode = AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).themeMode;  
```

The above example will return a value of the *enum* used by **MaterialApp's** **ThemeMode** with one of the following values:

**system** - *Use either the light or dark theme based on what the user has selected in the system settings.*

**light** - *Always use the light mode regardless of system preference.*

**dark** - *Always use the dark mode (if available) regardless of system preference.*


#### Current app ThemeId

To get the ID of the current theme, for example to create a selection UI as done in the example 
app provided with this package, call

```dart
  final themeId = AdaptiveChameleonTheme.of(context).themeId;
```


## Example

The example app can be found in the `example` folder. It implements a dropdown menu to select 
between 5 themes. The app is the source for the video demo above.
